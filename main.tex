\title{Preliminary Comparison of CRISPR/Cas9-based Screening Data Analysis Algorithms}

\author[1,*]{Y.Q. Yang}

\begin{abstract}
In the opening report of CRISPR/Cas9-based Screening Data Analysis, I introduced MAGeCK and BAGEL, which are both CRISPR/Cas9-based screening data analysis algorithms that can be applied for essential gene identification.  However, I only summarized the principles of two algorithms, but did not explicitly compare the difference between them in all aspects.  Therefore, I added detailed comparison information in this report, and preliminary process the screening data given by Professor Wang. Due to lack of time as well as corresponding data, the screening data were only calculated via MAGeCK.

\section*{Background}

MAGeCK and BAGEL are two known tools that have been specifically designed for CRISPR/CAS9-based essential gene identification. In order to find out which relatively performs better, I have to compare them from both their detailed algorithms in different steps and the actual analysis results obtained from on our own reserach data.  According to the above requirements, I generally planned my project workflow as below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item (1) Compare the principle of screening data analysis between two methods in all aspects(listed in order):
        \subitem read count calculation;
        \subitem read count normalization;
        \subitem sgRNA ranking;
        \subitem essential gene ranking;
    \item (2) Rank sgRNA and identify essential genes via two methods based on absolutely the same screening data.
    \item (3) Identify enriched pathway via MAGeCK only since this function is not inclued in BAGEL.
    \item (4) Compare MAGeCK with other pathway analysis tools and find out which one does a better job.
    \item (5) Summarize the tools that perform well at each step, improve the deficiencies, and thus generating a new workflow for CRISPR/Cas9-based essential gene and enriched pathway identification.
    \end{itemize}

Detailed principle comparison between MAGeCK and BAGEL is listed in Table \ref{tab:comparison}.  It is clear that MAGeCK and BAGEL identify essential genes in totally distinct methods.  Although the developer of BAGEL claims that BAGEL has lower False Discovery Rate(FDR) rather than MAGeCK since the latter one ranks essential gene simply based on the experimental data and hence hard to prevent from unexpected data fluctuation; however, we still cannot rush to a final conclusion immediately without running these methods on our own data.
From my personal view, we should take on several experiments to test whether BAGEL can be reliable for our own-data analysis since we cannot find enough explanation about the details for each step.  First, we should test whether the essential-gene ranking results would change with the existence of different reference geneset.  Second, we should figure out its read count calculation and normalization methods to see what factors would affect the operating results.
